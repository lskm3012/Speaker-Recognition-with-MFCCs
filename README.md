# Speaker-Recognition-with-MFCCs

The project includes MATLAB code for training and testing speaker-phrase recognition models for both closed (without impostors) and open-set (with impostors) purposes. Data from the Free Spoken Digit Database and Audio MNIST are used here. Both models have been trained and tested with six speakers uttering all digits from 0 to 9. The models yield an average closed-set accuracy of 96 % and an equal error rate of 2.2 %. The project also includes a conference-style paper explaining all concepts regarding the models in detail. 
NOTE: The data files would need to be unzipped before running the main.m files.
